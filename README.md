## What It Does

ApplyPilot is a job application pipeline. It discovers jobs across 5+ boards, scores them against your resume with AI, tailors your resume per job, and writes cover letters. From there you either **submit by hand** from a dashboard that hands you the job link and the generated PDFs, or let it **submit for you** via browser automation.

```bash
pip install applypilot
pip install --no-deps python-jobspy && pip install pydantic tls-client requests markdownify regex
applypilot init                      # one-time setup: resume, profile, preferences, API keys
applypilot doctor                    # verify your setup — what's installed, what's missing

applypilot run discover enrich score # find and score jobs
applypilot dashboard                 # approve the good ones in your browser
applypilot run tailor cover pdf      # generate resumes + cover letters for approved jobs
applypilot dashboard                 # Ready to Apply: open each posting, grab the PDFs, apply
```

Nothing is tailored until you approve it — the LLM stages only run on jobs you've said yes to, which keeps API usage on jobs you actually want.

Prefer hands-free? Add `applypilot apply` at the end for autonomous browser submission (see [Auto-Apply](#auto-apply)).

> **Why two install commands?** `python-jobspy` pins an exact numpy version in its metadata that conflicts with pip's resolver, but works fine at runtime with any modern numpy. The `--no-deps` flag bypasses the resolver; the second command installs jobspy's actual runtime dependencies. Everything except `python-jobspy` installs normally.

## Two Paths

Both paths are identical up to the point where documents are ready. They differ only in who submits the application.

### Assisted (no extra dependencies)
**Requires:** Python 3.11+, Gemini API key (free)

Discovers, scores, tailors, and writes cover letters. The **Ready to Apply** dashboard then gives you each approved job's posting link with its resume and cover letter as PDFs, plus a *Mark as Applied* button to track what you've sent. You do the form-filling; everything else is prepared.

Nothing here needs Node, Chrome, or the Claude Code CLI, so there's no browser automation to hang.

### Autonomous
**Requires:** the above, plus Node.js 18+, Chrome, and the Claude Code CLI

Claude Code drives a real browser to fill and submit the forms for you. Powerful, but it depends on a live browser session and real-world ATS forms — expect to babysit it more than the assisted path.

## The Pipeline

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Discover** | Scrapes 5 job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs) + 48 Workday employer portals + 30 direct career sites |
| **2. Enrich** | Fetches full job descriptions via JSON-LD, CSS selectors, or AI-powered extraction |
| **3. Score** | AI rates every job 1-10 based on your resume and preferences |
| **→ Review** | **You approve or reject.** Nothing downstream runs until you do — this gate is what keeps LLM spend on jobs you actually want |
| **4. Tailor** | AI rewrites your resume per approved job: reorganizes, emphasizes relevant experience, adds keywords. Never fabricates |
| **5. Cover Letter** | AI generates a targeted cover letter per job |
| **6. PDF** | Renders both to PDF — resumes and cover letters each get their own layout |
| **7. Apply** | Either you, from the Ready to Apply dashboard, or Claude Code driving a browser |

Each stage is independent. Run them all or pick what you need.

## Requirements

| Component | Required For | Details |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Python 3.11+ | Everything | Core runtime |
| Gemini API key | Scoring, tailoring, cover letters | Free tier (15 RPM / 1M tokens/day) is enough |
| Playwright Chromium | PDF generation | `python -m playwright install chromium` — one time |
| Node.js 18+ | Auto-apply only | Needed for `npx` to run Playwright MCP server |
| Chrome/Chromium | Auto-apply only | Auto-detected on most systems |
| Claude Code CLI | Auto-apply only | Install from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) |

The bottom three are only needed for autonomous submission — the assisted path never launches them.

Playwright's Chromium is what renders the PDFs. If it's missing or out of date, PDF generation fails while the `.txt` files are still written; `applypilot run pdf` picks them up again once it's installed.

**Gemini API key is free.** Get one at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com). OpenAI and local models (Ollama/llama.cpp) are also supported.

### Optional

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| CapSolver API key | Solves CAPTCHAs during auto-apply (hCaptcha, reCAPTCHA, Turnstile, FunCaptcha). Without it, CAPTCHA-blocked applications just fail gracefully |

> **Note:** python-jobspy is installed separately with `--no-deps` because it pins an exact numpy version in its metadata that conflicts with pip's resolver. It works fine with modern numpy at runtime.

---

## Configuration

All generated by `applypilot init`:

### `profile.json`
Your personal data in one structured file: contact info, work authorization, compensation, experience, skills, resume facts (preserved during tailoring), and EEO defaults. Powers scoring, tailoring, and form auto-fill.

### `searches.yaml`
Job search queries, target titles, locations, boards. Run multiple searches with different parameters.

### `.env`
API keys and runtime config: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`, `CAPSOLVER_API_KEY` (optional).

### Package configs (shipped with ApplyPilot)
- `config/employers.yaml` - Workday employer registry (48 preconfigured)
- `config/sites.yaml` - Direct career sites (30+), blocked sites, base URLs, manual ATS domains
- `config/searches.example.yaml` - Example search configuration

---

## How Stages Work

### Discover
Queries Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs via JobSpy. Scrapes 48 Workday employer portals (configurable in `employers.yaml`). Hits 30 direct career sites with custom extractors. Deduplicates by URL.

### Enrich
Visits each job URL and extracts the full description. 3-tier cascade: JSON-LD structured data, then CSS selector patterns, then AI-powered extraction for unknown layouts.

### Score
AI scores every job 1-10 against your profile. 9-10 = strong match, 7-8 = good, 5-6 = moderate, 1-4 = skip. Only jobs above your threshold reach the review queue.

### Review — the approval gate
Scored jobs wait here. **Tailoring will not run on a job you haven't approved**, so this step is required, not optional.

Approve in the browser via `applypilot dashboard`, or from the terminal:

```bash
applypilot review --list                 # show what's pending
applypilot review                        # interactive: approve/reject one by one
applypilot review --approve URL
applypilot review --reject URL --note "contract role"
```

### Tailor
Generates a custom resume per job: reorders experience, emphasizes relevant skills, incorporates keywords from the job description. Your `resume_facts` (companies, projects, metrics) are preserved exactly. The AI reorganizes but never fabricates.

### Cover Letter
Writes a targeted cover letter per job referencing the specific company, role, and how your experience maps to their requirements.

### PDF
Renders the generated `.txt` files to PDF next to their source. Resumes and cover letters use different templates — a cover letter gets a business-letter layout, not the resume's section grid.

```bash
applypilot run pdf     # converts anything still missing a PDF
```

### Apply Manually — the Ready to Apply dashboard

```bash
applypilot dashboard   # http://127.0.0.1:7410
```

Below the Review Queue, **Ready to Apply** lists every approved job whose documents are ready. Each card gives you:

- the job title, linking straight to the application page
- **Resume** and **Cover Letter** as PDF (or `txt` if the PDF hasn't been generated)
- a **Mark as Applied** button

Open the posting, upload the two PDFs, submit, then click *Mark as Applied* — the card drops off the list. Jobs the auto-apply worker failed on or left mid-run also surface here, badged with why, so nothing gets stranded.

Marking writes `apply_status='applied'` with `agent_id='self'`, so it survives `--reset-failed` and the auto-apply worker won't pick the job up again. Misclicked? `applypilot apply --mark-failed URL` puts it back.

> Use `applypilot dashboard`, not `--no-server`. The static snapshot still opens documents from disk, but *Mark as Applied* needs the local server and is disabled without it.

### Auto-Apply
Claude Code launches a Chrome instance, navigates to each application page, detects the form type, fills personal information and work history, uploads the tailored resume and cover letter, answers screening questions with AI, and submits. A live dashboard shows progress in real-time.

The Playwright MCP server is configured automatically at runtime per worker. No manual MCP setup needed.

```bash
# Utility modes (no Chrome/Claude needed)
applypilot apply --mark-applied URL    # manually mark a job as applied
applypilot apply --mark-failed URL     # manually mark a job as failed
applypilot apply --reset-failed        # reset all failed jobs for retry
applypilot apply --gen --url URL       # generate prompt file for manual debugging
```
